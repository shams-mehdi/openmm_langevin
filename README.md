# openmm_langevin
Tutorial demonstrating the use of OpenMM for performing Langevin Dynamics simulations for 1 particle in 3D (Langevin_Dynamics.ipynb). Any arbitrary potential energy function can be easily defined and enhanced sampling (Metadynamics) can be implemented through PLUMED. Generated data for Two_well, Four_well, Muller-brown potential are provided in './data/'.
